            <h2>about us</h2>
            <h4>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international non-governmental organization founded in 1961 that works in the field of wilderness preservation and the reduction of human impact on the environment.
                It was formerly named the World Wildlife Fund, which remains its official name in Canada and the United States.
                WWF aims to "stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.

            <div class="artical">
                <p>WWF works to help local communities conserve the natural resources they depend upon; transform markets and policies toward sustainability; and protect and restore species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from a local to a global scale.
                    Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but itâ€™s also people who have the power to change this trajectory. Together, we can address the greatest threats to life on this planet and protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.
                    WWF is a really good charity organisation, with the charity getting donations online, by mobile and from advertisments the organisation helps animals and their habitat to stop them becoming extinct.
                    we can protect threatened species and their habitats today with a donation to World Wildlife Fund.
